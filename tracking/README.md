Time tracking tools
===================

Simple tools for time tracking and report generation.


`time-track.el` is an Emacs script for time tracking. Use interactive
function `time-track-add-entry` to add new entry (default tracking log
is `~/.time-track.log`).


`gen_weekly_report` generates report for a given week.
